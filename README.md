Weather Dashboard

This weather dashboard utilizes the OpenWeather API https://openweathermap.org/api to retrieve current and 5 day forecast weather data based on the city the user enters.

UV index data is color coded based on levels as follows:
* low = 2 or less - coded green
* moderate = 5 or less but above 2 - coded yellow
* high = anything above 5 - coded red

Previously searched cities are saved on the dashboard and can be searched again by clicking their buttons. Doing so removes the button from the dashboard.

Bootstrap was used for the UI https://getbootstrap.com/ 
Save icon provided by Font Awesome https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/
Moment.js API was used for date calculation https://momentjs.com/
